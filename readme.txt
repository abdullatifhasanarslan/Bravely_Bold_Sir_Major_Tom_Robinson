This is an uncomplete project. 
Basically for first step it should visualize any C code. 
Then it should be practical to developing program without using any code by only using this program.
The step after that is more focused about style optimization, and creating community.

deneme.py will start to program

To open it pyprocessing should be installed.
pyprocessing library:
